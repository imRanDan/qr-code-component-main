## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- TailwindCSS

### What I learned

Figuring out a new technology, struggling, and then eventually putting something together was a big win for me. I learned how to use flex, padding, margins, custom elements, and basic setup to get tailwind working for this project.

```html
<div class="h-screen flex flex-col items-center 
  justify-center w-1/3 absolute left-1/3 h-64">
```
}

### Continued development

As this is my first project with TailwindCSS, I found it a bit difficult to figure out what the shortforms meant, so I will need to keep the documentation handy and as I build more projects I will get used to what everything means.

I also found that while I was able to get the project to be responsive horizontally, if I were to work on this more or come back to it later for further optimizations, I would add vertical responsiveness too.



### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The documentation (more specifically the search bar in the documentation) has a huge help in getting me to figure out how to style everything. Figuring out what all the shortform commands meant to make sure the margins, padding, and flex-box 

- [Traversy Media Tailwind CrashCourse] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ&list=WL&index=2&t=4m35s) - I used the startup/installation method used in Traversy Media's video to set-up my project. I learned to implement and automate some of the tailwind installations so I wouldn't have to run it in terminal every time (in my package.json file)
